Primary Goal


Deliver actionable insights and recommendations derived from the data analysis to address the business query effectively.

Based on the thorough analysis conducted on the provided data, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

1) Implement a targeted advertising campaign specifically aimed at attracting casual riders, particularly leading up to the summer season. 
By raising awareness about the benefits and convenience of utilizing Cyclistic's services, a significant increase in casual ridership could be anticipated.

2) Inform casual riders about the potential cost savings achievable by transitioning to a membership subscription. 
This could be achieved by offering promotional incentives such as free trials or discounted rates during the summer months. 
Demonstrating the long-term value of membership and the potential savings it offers may encourage casual riders to convert to loyal members.

3) Establish a member reward program to incentivize and appreciate dedicated users.
By acknowledging and rewarding members for their loyalty, Cyclistic can foster a sense of belonging and boost customer retention.
This initiative may also catalyze casual users to consider becoming subscribed members to avail themselves of these exclusive benefits.

4) Expand the services available to annual members by introducing docked bikes as an option. 
By offering multiple bike types, where members can choose between docked and dockless options, Cyclistic can cater to varied user preferences and provide a more flexible and tailored experience for its valued subscribers.


Implementing these recommendations has the potential to enhance user engagement, increase membership conversion rates, and ultimately drive business growth for Cyclistic. 
Continued monitoring and evaluation of user feedback and market trends will be crucial to fine-tune these strategies and ensure their long-term success.
